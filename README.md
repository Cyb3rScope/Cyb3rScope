Hi, I’m CyberScope, or my actual name Hashir. I am a 13 year old boy who likes Maths, Sciences and other subjects but most of all Computer science.
I’m interested in Game development, Machine learning, AI, Web design, Graphic design, 3D modeling, Music production and animation. I also run a youtube 
channel in my free time and you can subscribe to me here: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJVusAZcSSnmGOG6qFJDLVw. Anyways, have a great day and bye!
